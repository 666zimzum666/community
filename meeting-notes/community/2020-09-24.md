## Notes

* This meeting will now only take place when we have an agenda
    * Check in the Slack channel to make sure there is one
* [Profiles proposal](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/pull/98)
    * Lots of interesting use cases for this
    * Proposal to move forward: Reduce scope to single file that can be used for local dev and then deployed to the cloud
    * Move other use cases to another issue/PR
    * Nicolas will action this
* docker-compose 1.27.4 was just released :tada:
* [docker/compose-cli](https://github.com/docker/compose-cli) was just open sourced
    * Also a [Node SDK](https://github.com/docker/node-sdk)
* Cutting specification releases
    * Reported by Sebastiaan that for tool builders it's good to have a versioned release
    * Semver vs something like the date
    * No strong opinion
    * Would also be useful to have schema hosted somewhere
    * Could also investigate schema.org
* [Dedeprecate runtime field](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/issues/101)
    * Brought up by Akihiro on the spec tracker
    * Goal thus far has been to keep the spec backward compatible
    * Chris: Not clear what the long term use case for this but agree about backward compat
        * Something like Docker Context could be used to do this for all services
* Junlin shared his containerd Compose tool:
