### Agenda

* Welcome newcomers!
* (Michael, Peter) Deploying a Compose file to Kubernetes
* (Peter) An approach at handling local routing using an nginx/docker-gen based container (wrt https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/issues/111)
* (Chris) Sebastiaan has hesitations about [adding the project name](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/issues/106)
* (Chris) Platform for build in the spec

### Notes

* Michael and Peter demo deploying Compose on Kubernetes
    * Mike's demo
        * Comes from building a platform at VT
        * [See code here](https://github.com/mikesir87/helm-charts)
        * Want tooling that doesn't require developers be experts in the underlying orchestrator
        * Using Flux v1
        * Find Compose the be the right abstraction level for this
        * Would like source of truth to be Compose file
        * Consumes Compose file as values for Helm chart
            * Allows using Kubernetes now with option to pivot to ECS or something else later
        * Need some extensions to Compose for things like ingress
    * Peter's demo
        * Working on a cloud platform with a similar goals
        * https://shipyard.build
        * Creates template Compose file based on languages developers want to use
        * Creates ephemeral environment for pull requests
        * Ask [Peter](mailto:peter@shipyard.build) for an invite if you'd like access!
    * Nicolas linked a [Kubernetes mapping doc](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/tree/wip_kube_mapping) so that we can get more aligned on this mapping
* (Peter) Routing [issue](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/issues/111)
    * Need some kind of path based routing
    * Currently using labels
        * https://github.com/shipyardbuild/compose-ingress
    * Nicolas worried about adding extensions that are too platform specific
        * Goal of custom extensions is a playground for things that can be pulled into the spec later
        * Want us to be able to run things locally and very platform specific extensions will break this
* (Chris) [Project name in the spec](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/issues/106)
    * Lots of debate about pros and cons
    * Nicolas didn't have a strong opinion originally but now against this
    * Seems like main use case is for deploying the same app multiple times
    * Could solve this in tooling: flags, arguments, etc.
    * Nicolas will add a comment on the issue
* (Chris) Platform for build in the spec
    * Apple's new Macs have made this particularly necessary
    * Would be good to align Compose better with what's in the Docker CLI for build
        * Only where it makes sense for others
    * Multiplatform is obvious
