### Agenda

* Welcome newcomers!
* Nicolas - overview to date
* Open forum

### Notes
* Nicolas: Given an overview of what has been done in the Compose Specification so far
    * Want to re-introduce all the Compose V2 attributes
    * Drop the requirement for version, so what you put in the file will be checked against the platform & your tool will warn you
    * Want to avoid people thinking V2 is for Local and V3 is for cloud - want the Compose file format to be universal
* Nicolas: In terms of implementation
    * Docker extracted the Compose Go library into a dedicated repo in the Compose spec
    * Merged a PR to provide a model 'project' that will be the result of agregating multiple compose files
    * Has a layer to check compatibility
* Nicolas: Interesting proposal, sent on the Docker Compose repo but the idea is generich https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/7539
    * Acknowledge that a Compose file may have 'other' containers that are used as one off tasks
        * Run debugs
        * Run tests
    * Proposal is to allow specific syntax in the Compose file so you can define these containers in your compose file but won't be started by default when you do a Compose Up
    * Interesting topic to discuss
* Nicolas" One of the challenges we have today is to make keep Docker Compose compliant with the Compose specification
    * Want as least that Compose spec compliant files will work with Docker Compose
* Till - Adding tasks to Compose, there was a similar discussion for Docker images in general.
    * You have a very limited amount of things you can specify an image can do
    * Would this be something to take up with OCI people to support in the image, to support some tasks in the image/app container to do with DB
        * Nicolas - the issue at the image level is that this becomes an OCI runtime discussion, lack understanding of how we would move this into OCI
        * If we want to address at the Compose level, we would need a more declartive approach. The hook approach from K8s may make sense
        * Till: also taking part in OCI meetings which is why this option is something to consider
        * Eric: reminded the talk 'labels labels labels' from Dockercon where you could store a K8s manifest in a Docker label. Which is a gross over use but gives an example
        * Eric: for lifecycle it could be interesting to see what lifecycle events you might define, if you could do something before main service has started it may not be useful. Then if you are trying to check if your main service has started that would be a lot of overhead for developers
        * Eric: compose tools tend to be file/forget and don't have a daemon. Don't have interaction with the lifecycle.
        * Till: Previous trick, when NGinx starts up and needs lifecycle things, this needs to be handled in the startup script. Define specific outcomes in that startup script
        * Nicolas: need to dig in to understand the usecase/benefit that this could provide and make sure it is implementation agnostic
* Eric: Discuss V2 story, is extends the last bit that is missing from V2 before this is closed out?
    * Nicolas: Extends is one we need to define clearly, from the Docker Compose code there are no complications in how this is implemented
    * Eric: how can we help
        * Nicolas: propose in the spec how we could do the extend in the Compose specification
