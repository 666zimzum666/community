### Agenda

* Welcome newcomers!
* (Chris) docker-compose removing requirement for spec version ([PR](https://github.com/docker/compose/pull/7588))
* (Chris) Remove merge requirement for PRs to be up to date with main branch
    * Specifically related to https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/pull/60

### Notes

* Ben will make sure the calendar invite is updated.
* Welcome newcomers, Peter Valdez.
* PR 7588 - removed the version requirement from Compose, the decision was to make Compose based on the features not the version of the spec. This is merged into docker-compose.
* The change to no longer use version will be released as a beta to make sure Docker has not broken anyone
* The next release of dockerCompose will also have dropped Python 2 as that is EOL
* Currently on the Compose spec repo you cannot merge branches unless they are up to date with the main branch
    * No strong opinion on whether we have this in place
* Eric: With V2/V3 merge, who can we talk to about the Compose spec changes in Docker-Compose
    * Ping Chris Crone on this and he will review
* Peter: Things that are merged into Compose spec and how that moves into the Docker-Compose CLI
    * Making a best effort to move these into the Compose CLI
    * Have released Compose support for ACI and ECS in latest Docker Desktop
    * So have some Compose Go started and want to release this in the next ~6 months of so
* K8s mapping, not sure how we start doing this.
    * Ben will kick off a thread in the community slack channels to start discussion on this going forward
