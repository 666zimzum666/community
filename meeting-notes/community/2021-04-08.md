### Agenda

* Welcome newcomers!
* Any demos?
* Better documentation for Compose spec, see https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/issues/115
* Native system service wrapper for compose apps
* (Chris) [Spec versioning for tool makers](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/issues/104)

### Notes

* Eric [Better documentation for Compose spec](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/issues/115)
    * Based on issues from collegues and external issues
    * Often heated arguments
    * Docker docs are quite prominent but not as up to date as the Compose spec docs
    * Causing a lot of confusion
    * Potential solution is to generate docs
    * Chris: Would be good to mirror this on docs.docker.com and elsewhere as well
        * Mike: Will be some drift between spec and tooling
    * Eric: Would be good to have a compatibility matrix for features so that users understand
    * Decision: Get this merged in the repo and then work out where to host, probably compose-spec.io
    * Mike: Would be good to have standarized documentation as this makes moving between tools easier
    * Nicolas: Could use badges on features to show which tools support them
* Native system service wrapper for compose apps
    * Punted to next time as none of the attendees raised this
* (Chris) [Spec versioning for tool makers](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/issues/104)
    * Chris: Would like to make it easier for tool makers to specify a point in time in the spec
        * Should not be exposed to users
        * Parsing libraries like compose-go could use semver, this should not
        * Proposal to use a date tag
        * Chris will propose a lightweight process for this
* Eric: [Build secrets follow-up](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/issues/81#issuecomment-782254271)
    * Eric: Secrets would be useful
    * Chris: There might be a difference between build secrets and deployment secrets
        * Could cause confusion
    * Eric: Could be up to tools to decide where to get secrets
    * Chris will add this to the issue
* TOML support
    * Chris: Think other formats are fine so long as they can represent the Compose model
    * Nicolas: The spec should have at least one canonical text format (e.g.: YAML in UTF-8)
        * Tools should be able to handle this and export to it
    * Jacob: What about literals
* nerdctl is adding Compose support :tada:
    * Nicolas: Would be good to get Akihiro to do a demo
