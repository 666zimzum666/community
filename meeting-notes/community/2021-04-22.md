### Notes

* Intros
    * Anuj: AWS, working on Docker AWS integrations
        * Want to streamline deployment of Compose to ECS
* (Michael) Implementing compose-go in other languages
    * Michael: Would like to have a Compose AWS CDK integration and that's where this idea started
        * Team uses Javascript so Typescript would be ideal
        * Would love a compose-ts like compose-go
    * Anuj: Something like this would be useful for handling corner cases not currently handled by Compose ECS integration. CDK is the right place to do this.
    * Chris: Plus one! We could add this to the compose-spec org but should make sure projects are maintained
        * Spec versioning would help here
    * Nicolas: Don't want to put in place barrier to entry to putting this in compose-spec
        * Would prefer to encourage people to contribute to the spec directly
    * Eric: What does this mean for Python docker-compose?
        * Should this be converted to an SDK
    * Michael: Will be starting this in private namespace and then move it to the compose-spec org
        * Will collaborate with Anuj
* (Eric) Are we able to land https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/pull/147? (once conflicts are resolved)
    * Eric: We were in agreement last meeting but this is missing one LGTM
    * Chris: Found where the compose-spec.io site code is, will work on moving it to the repo
* (Chris) [Versioning](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/issues/104)
    * Chris: Presented proposal
    * Eric: Having a changelog will be really useful
    * Nicolas: We have automation for changelogs in the docker-compose release process
    * Agreement that this is OK
