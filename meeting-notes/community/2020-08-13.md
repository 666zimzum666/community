### Notes

* Welcome Guillaume!
* (Nicolas) Proposal to support hierachical secrets (Kubernetes/AWS style) ([Issue](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/issues/93))
    * While working on support for secrets on AWS ran into limitation of Compose: does not allow secret hierarchy
    * Docker ran into this with Compose on Kubernetes too so know this is broader issue than just AWS
    * Proposal for new attribute in the Compose format for secrets
    * Another possible issue is that the secret path is hard coded (`/run/secret/<secret name>`)
    * Proposal works for AWS
    * Release of Docker Desktop Edge next Tuesday will include this to get feedback
* Docker Compose now versionless! See the [latest RC](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/1.27.0-rc1)
    * Download it and try it!
    * Feedback will be really useful while we have this out as an RC
    * Also drops Python 2 support
    * Guillaume will test against Awesome Compose
* [GPU support](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/issues/74#issuecomment-670851982)
    * Will discuss more next time when Eric is here
    * It looks like a good proposal
