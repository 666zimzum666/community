### Agenda

* Welcome newcomers!
* Reviews for [Specify the behaviour of extends field](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/pull/86)

### Notes

* Nicolas: Eric's [PR](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/pull/86)
    * Work on readding v2 fields to v3 of spec
    * Specifically this PR adds `extends` fields
    * Aim is to include this in compose-go so that it can be used elsewhere
    * How should we handle services that reference other services?
        * Eric: Could block or allow this
        * Nicolas: Could allow implementers to choose
            * Feel we should be conservative here
            * Might need real use cases to make a decision on this
        * Eric: Agree that restricting this would be good and will update PR
* Nicolas: docker-compose updates
    * Anca (at Docker) is working on updating docker-compose to match changes to the spec
        * Removing requirement on `version` field
* Chris: We released ACI support in the Docker CLI (in beta) this week
    * It's included in Docker Desktop Edge or for Linux [here](https://github.com/docker/aci-integration-beta)
    * We're using the updated Compose spec and compose-go at Docker!
* Run through open PRs that need review:
    * [Add NOTICE file](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/pull/85)
* Nicolas: Next issues that need discussion or work
    * [Add option to specify services to be started by default](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/issues/87)
        * Multiple options for how to implement this
        * Appears that _services_ abstraction is too restrictive for some use cases
            * Another example is for jobs
* Jobs
    * Eric: Are these a developer use case?
    * Chris: Maybe, we need to dig into the actual use cases
    * David: Would be useful as people drive workloads to the cloud
        * Connect your job to a network with long running services would be useful
    * Nicolas: Compose extension mechanim will allow people who write tools to propose things and then we can make a decision
    * Jeremy: [Compose issue](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/7539)
