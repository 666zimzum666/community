### Notes

* Welcome newcomers!
    * Anca, maintainer on docker-compose works at Docker
* Project name in Compose file (https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/issues/106)
    * tl;dr: Should project name be added to the  Compose file
    * Justin: Very old issue
    * Chris: Possible problems with this:
        * Cannot up the same stack multiple times on the same machine
        * Risk of up replacing an existing stack
        * Risk of down doing something unexpected
    * Justin: Could use (reverse) FQDN for names as a workaround
    * Chris: What about random names or using the name in the Compose file as a seed for the full name?
        * Not backward compatible
    * Jusin: Other suggestion was to have this in a different file
    * Jacob: Current docker-compose adds label with path that could be used as a check
    * Jacob: When merging Compose files with project name, last one wins
    * Roman: Don't see downsides that we don't have already to adding this
        * Just another place that one can specify the name
    * Chris: I'll summarize discussion and add to issue tomorrow
