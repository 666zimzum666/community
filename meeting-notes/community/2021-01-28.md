### Agenda

* Welcome newcomers!
* Any demos?
* (Eric) Build-time secrets (see https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/issues/81)
  * SSH
  * File-based
* (Nicolas) align Pull_policy valus with docker CLI (see https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/pull/136)
* (Chris) Compose -> Kubernetes mapping

### Notes

* Welcome newcomers!
    * Nicolas: Engineer at Docker on the Compose CLI
    * Michael: Virginia Tech, using Compose with Helm charts
    * Marina: PM at Docker
* Demos!
    * Jacob promised to have one next time
* (Eric) Build-time secrets (see https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/issues/81)
    * Bumped to next time when Eric's here :)
* (Nicolas) align Pull_policy valus with docker CLI (see https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/pull/136)
    * Currently the Docker CLI and Compose spec have different values
    * Proposal is to align Compose spec with the Docker CLI
    * Michael: Kubernetes differs from Docker
        * Not sure this is important though
    * Nicolas: Use aliases to support values already specified in the spec
    * No objection
* (Chris) Compose -> Kubernetes mapping
    * Meeting was on Tuesday
    * Michael gives rundown of the meeting
        * Listed existing tools that used Compose with Kubernetes
        * Canonical place for discussions will be on `KUBERNETES_MAPPING.md`
        * Plan is to meet monthly
    * Peter's notes:
        * Secret handling
        * Extension fields can fill in gaps - e.g. x-ingress
        * Helm charts are tough to extend
        * k8s-to-compose - 10x more questions
        * Compose CLI - docker compose up --context kube
        * Take a look at the WIP branch mapping (feedback on compose-spec repo) - https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/wip_kube_mapping/KUBERNETES_MAPPING.md
        * Testing is tough - donâ€™t want 20 min cluster startup time (kind may help)
    * Chris wrote this a long time ago: https://github.com/docker/compose-on-kubernetes/blob/master/docs/mapping.md
* (Michael) [Add a dependsOn condition to wait for successful completion](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/pull/134)
    * Some minor changes but looks good
