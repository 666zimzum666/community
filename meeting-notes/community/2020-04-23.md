### Notes

* Welcome!
* Introductions
    * Justin Cormack: Docker
        * Excited to finally have the specification out as an open spec
        * Want to find out how people are using Compose and make it no longer just Docker specific
    * Nicolas de Loof: Docker
        * Work on Compose and related things
    * Chris Crone: Docker
        * Engineering manager at Docker responsible for Compose
    * Ben de St Paer-Gotch: Docker
        * Product manager on Compose
    * Ben Firshman: ex-Docker
        * Co-creator of Compose
        * Here because he has historical knowledge of Compose specification
        * Very happy to see this happen, intention of Fig (original name) was to build something like this
    * David Giffin: Release
        * Using Compose for getting workloads to Kubernetes
        * Want Compose to be more production
    * Silvin: Docker
        * Work on Docker App which consumes Docker Compose
    * Till Wegmueller: OpenFlowLabs and illumos Community
        * Using Compose and Kubernetes on illumos
        * Implementing OCI compliant runtime and support tools Aurora OpenCloud https://git.wegmueller.it/opencloud/opencloud
    * Jeremey: Release
        * Here to learn more and see how specification progresses
    * Jacob Howard: Mutagen
        * Interested in the spec and bringing it to the cloud
    * Darragh: 56k Cloud
        * Big users of Compose for local development
        * Experienced in using ECS CLI Compose tools
    * Jochen Zehnder: 56k Cloud
    * Alex Hicks: PhD student
        * Using Docker Compose for projects
        * Taught computational history course and included containerisation
    * Djordje Lukic: Docker
        * Compose, Docker App
        * Excited about the spec and feedback on it!
* JC: There are a bunch of open issues on the specification containing things that we think we should change
    * We'd love your feedback on them and help in evolving them
    * Particularly around reconciling v2 and v3
* JC: Feel that people should not need to put version number at the top of the Compose file
    * Darragh: Being able to pin on a version is a good thing for projects that don't evolve quickly
        * Backward compatibility is important
* DG: Interested in extends and combining Compose files
    * JC: Don't remember why extends was removed
    * BF: Think this was with move to Stacks and Swarm
* CC: Spec is rough because we wanted to share it early and genuinely engage with the community
* JC: If you have issues, please add them to the repo
* JC: Would like a working group on Kubernetes mappings
    * DG: Interested in Kubernetes mapping
    * JC: Can create an epic to track issues associated with this
    * DG: Mounts and ports are particularly tricky
    * JC: Networking as a whole is tricky as nothing maps that well to the Docker model
* TW: Worried that Compose spec becomes too complicated if we don't set scope and goals clearly
    * CC: Vision document covers some of this: https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/VISION.md
* CC: Future of Compose livestream link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPpyDfPyuJ0
