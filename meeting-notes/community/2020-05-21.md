### Agenda

* Welcome newcomers!
* (Chris Crone) Compose spec and GPUs (https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/issues/74)
* Dropping version requirement (https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/issues/13)

### Notes

* GPUs. Declarative vs non declarative APIs. Declarative API is what pretty much everything except Docker engine supports. Look at existing practise, eg CUDA (device caps etc), OpenCL, cloud providers, Nvidia-docker. Are we using generic attributes or vendor specific? Helpful to do an overview of existing APIs. More generic than the Docker "just use this device" model. See also Microsoft post on WSL2 https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/directx-heart-linux/. Could use CUDA and opencl but now there are so many frameworks. Does it make sense to use these as entry points?
* Compose Trademark. AFAIK not a trademark. Anyone should be able to implement and call it Compose X.
* Where are recordings going?
