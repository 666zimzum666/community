### Agenda

* Welcome newcomers!
* Any demos?
  * (Jacob) Compose with cloud-based Docker Engine ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18ebn5M2NYycKuQ24gWJ4NOoNu-RRHi4G4Q_BGWcj8b4/edit?usp=sharing))
* (Eric) [Build-time secrets](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/issues/81)
  * SSH
  * File-based

### Notes

* (Jacob) Compose with cloud-based Docker Engine
    * Watch the video, it's a great demo!
        * [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18ebn5M2NYycKuQ24gWJ4NOoNu-RRHi4G4Q_BGWcj8b4/edit?usp=sharing)
    * Peter: What's the main use case?
        * More computing power potentially, for very large applications
        * M1 -> amd64 native development
        * Colocation of cloud components with dev containers
* (Eric) Build-time secrets (see https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/issues/81)
    * Issue is getting lots of traction, equal interest in SSH and file-based
    * Ensure that we can do this in at least two places: locally and somewhere else
    * Eric has enough direction and will draft a solution
