### Agenda

* Welcome newcomers!
* (Nicolas) Requirement of version field in the spec (https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/issues/13)

### Notes

* Nicolas: Requirement of having version field in the spec
    * https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/issues/13
    * Now that spec is open, we are more of a "loose" specification, we don't want to force all implementers to support all features
    * Feel that it would make more sense to do compatibility per feature rather than with a specified version
    * Proposal is to drop version field
    * PR for pull v2 features into spec is up and needs reviews
        * https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/pull/78
    * Dropping the version field will remove confusion between v2 and v3
    * Eric: Possibly something like "use strict" for Javascript? But in YAML ;)
    * Eric: Agree with everything above
        * Think that strict mode would be interesting to add
        * Versions don't make sense
    * Chris: Also agree with this
    * Nicolas: Put up PR on compose-go that allows whitelisting which features your implementation supports:
        * https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-go/pull/45
        * Chris: would like to see an auto generated version of this
    * David: I do wonder though - the underlying implementations from the various cloud providers might change or our implementations might have bugs that people take dependencies on. I wonder how we might do that without versions, ya know?
        * Nicolas: version in Compose file is of the specification
            * If we adopt this we would not be able to remove features
            * Tools will need to decide what features they support and what the feature means for their backend
            * Can still mark features as deprecated (leave them in the schema) and tools can reject the feature
            * Example of something that could be deprecated: scale in v2 has been replaced by deployment.replicas in v3
                * scale should still be part of our spec but should be translated by implementations into deployment.replicas
    * David: would we also warn on fields we don't know? e.g.: we add a new field like "dogs" will old versions of implementations warn or err on this?
    * Nicolas: Can offer both
    * Nicolas: No strong opinion against the removal of the version field on the public issue
        * Primary feedback is that people are surprised that the Compose spec is looser than most others
* Chris: Follow up on question last time: Where are the videos going?
    * Ben is currently owner of the meeting
    * Needs to get access to either the Docker YouTube or create a separate Compose account
    * Ben took an action to get this done for next time
* Nicolas will update the version issue
